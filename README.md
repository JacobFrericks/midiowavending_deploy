## What is this?
Simply, this is a website I developed for a friend.

The site has four pages, and a construction page. You can check those out at the directory /lib/pages. 
Other flutter code is located in the /lib directory.

While this was developed in Flutter, there is no mobile app in either iOS or Android. 
This is simply a website developed in Flutter. See the end product [here](https://www.midiowavending.com).
